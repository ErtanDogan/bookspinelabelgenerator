This website allows labels for library books to be created automatically.

Simply select the settings you want, and either download the PDF to print using the provided link or use the PDF viewer to print directly. Make sure to select the correct export file and the correct size. The default size of the pdf is 1in x 1.5in, but this will be automatically fit to the size set in the print tool. 

Enjoy!
